			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types & Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 5 was to use data types and create variables in JavaScript,
						and then output the JavaScript in HTML on our webpage. We were also tasked with
						creating a variable "age" that calculates the age of our vehicle using carYear 
						and currentYear, and pasting an image into HTML. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My lab partner had problems with a disappearing webpage, which we solved by 
						eliminating typos in JavaScript. I also had trouble with placing the code in 
						JavaScript (should it go in function Main? At the top? etc.), and I realized
						that variables should be placed at the top before any functions, while the
						output (document.writeln) should go in Main. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment took more time than most other ones due to the task of creating
						code in JavaScript. Making sure our program executed and printed the correct 
						information took some troubleshooting and various implementations. I spent a
						lot of time in this lab helping my classmates display the information correctly
						on their webpage, which was caused by a mix of JavaScript and HTML errors. 
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
