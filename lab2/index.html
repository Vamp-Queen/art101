					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a webpage using beginner-level HTML and 
						CSS elements, using HTML to display text and CSS to customize the appearance of
						our webpage. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our first problem was using CSS and getting our elements to display neatly on our 
						webpage. This included experimenting with the font-size, margins, and width. Our 
						next biggest hurdle was linking our Lab 2 to our homepage. We realized that the 
						correct link to include in "href" was not "C:\Users\Hailey\Desktop\art101\index.html", 
						but just "\art101\index.html". Finally, we included a link on Lab 2 back to our 
						homepage using the following HTML code: <a href= "\art101\lab2\index.html" target= 
						"_blank"> Lab 2: HTML & CSS Starter</a>. The most difficult part of this lab 
						was linking our Homepage and Lab 2 to one another. 
					</p>.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was a fun exercise in using HTML and CSS, and helped me to learn
						some of the basics of each. Siran and I used the challenge as an opportunity to
						have fun and experiment with different elements. Learning the basics of HTML and
						CSS should serve as good groundwork for what we'll learn during the rest of the 
						quarter.  </p>
