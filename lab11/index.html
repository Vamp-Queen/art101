					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 11 is to experiment with JavaScript events and forms, while
						working with a partner. My main challenge in this lab was experimenting with 
						different events such as the sort function, submit button, and the glitch feature.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I encountered some problems with JavaScript, especially with implementing my button 
						which sorts the inputted name. Overall, though, I didn't have too many issues with 
						this lab, as it mainly iterated on what we learned in previous labs.
