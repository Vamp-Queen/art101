			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays & Objects</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 6 was to use an array and an object, and learn how to
						output them correctly. Displaying the array was straightforward, while displaying 
						the object was more challenging. 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first, my script from JavaScript was not displaying locally on my webpage. After
						some troubleshooting, I learned that I still had leftover code from Lab 5 that was 
						displaying the variable "age," which is used differently in this Lab. Once I deleted
						that line, my script correctly displayed on my webpage. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a fun lab that iterated on what we learned in Lab 5. It was fun to experiment 
						with arrays and objects and to see the differences in how you have to treat them in the 
						JavaScript code. Most of my efforts in this lab were focused on coding in JavaScript.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You are viewing the index.html file I created. 
						Here is the program execution, outputting an array "myTransport" and an object "myMainRide":
