					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 14 is to use our debugging knowledge to fix old
						assignments, while working with a partner. The most difficult challenge
						was determining which code was causing the errors; sometimes it was hard
						to tell if it was the HTML or the JavaScript causing issues, and then it
						was difficult to pinpoint which code was at fault. 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
			<div id="problems"></div>
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I encountered some problems with pinpointing the source of my
						console errors. First, I had to determine whether it was the HTML, 
						CSS, or the JavaScript causing the errors, and then I had to look
						through the code to see what was causing the problems. I had help 
						from w3 schools and my partner to help with this.

				<h3>Lab 2</h3>

				<p>Here is the Debugging process for Lab 2. The main issue here was that I
					was linking to a local file in my Title HTML: " link rel="stylesheet" 
					type="text/css" href="C:\Users\Hailey\Desktop\art101\lab2\css\lab.css" ". 
					I resolved this error by linking instead to my css, and changing the code to:
					" link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/lab.css" ". After I made 
					this change, it resolved the console error and worked correctly.

				<h3>Lab 5</h3>

				<img id="lab5c" src="img/lab5c.png">
				<p>Here is the Debugging process for Lab 5. The main issue here was that I was
					using "document.writeln()" to output my JavaScript, which is meant to be used 
					while the page is still loading, not after it's done. While using "document.writeln"
					was part of the lab, I took this as an opportunity to learn the proper way to insert 
					content into a specific element, and not the whole page. I learned to use innerHTML 
					instead, and changed the lines of code to "output.innerHTML += ;".
