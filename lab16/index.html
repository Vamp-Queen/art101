					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 16 is to experiment with processing JSON from an API, 
						while working with a partner. The biggest challenge was navigating the
						broken "https://xkcd.com/info.0.json" link. Thanks to help from my partner 
						and some classmates, we were able to use a proxy for the site.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I encountered some problems navigating the broke "https://xkcd.com/info.0.json"
						link. My partner and I asked around and used a proxy site instead to get the 
						code working. After that, it was fairly simple to get the code working from 
						what we worked on in "jsbin.com" in our last lecture.
