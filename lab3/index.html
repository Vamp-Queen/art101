			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to observe our file structures and
						reference/link to different files (for example, by using img). 
						We also customized our homepage by adding paragraph text, images, 
						and a bulleted list that links to all of our Labs. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had the most trouble with resizing my selfie image. I had to use CSS 
						and adjust the width, but for some reason it wouldn't change the image
						size. After troubleshooting with my lab partner, I discovered that I
						wasn't using the same class name between html and css. Once I changed 
						them both to "selfie," the image resized as it should have. I also
						helped my partner to get their links working, which required double
						checking that the reference was correct (lab3/index.html). </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I learned a lot through troubleshooting problems, adding images to my
						homepage, and creating links to all of the labs. My lab partner Siran
						and I talked over the phone and texted each other when we ran into
						issues. After this Lab, I feel more confident in using elements such
						as img, href, headings, and paragraph text. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results of this lab were the added selfie and introduction on my 
						homepage, a bulleted list linking to all of my labs, and paragraph 
						text in Lab 3 describing my efforts.
