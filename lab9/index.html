					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 9 is to experiment with jQuery and use libraries, while 
						working together with a partner. The most challenging part was getting the 
						buttons to work properly with .special in lab.css.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>As stated above, getting the buttons to work properly in css and JavaScript 
						was by far the most challenging problem of Lab 9. My partner Siran helped
						a lot by looking at my code and suggesting tips. Proofreading also helped 
						to eliminate any typos in my code.
